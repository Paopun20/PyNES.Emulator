# PyNES Emulator

A NES (Nintendo Entertainment System) emulator written in 100% Python.

This project aims to emulate the 8-bit NES CPU (6502) and PPU (Picture Processing Unit) in pure Python. Currently, it's a work-in-progress (WIP), and not all CPU instructions or PPU features are implemented yet.

## Accuracy ( freeze out )

try to fix 84/125 bug freeze ( NMI OVERLAP BRK )

Not suitable for speedrunning at this timeâ€”please wait for future updates before using PyNES for these purposes.

## Features (some work in progress)

- **CPU Emulation**: Partial implementation of the 6502 CPU instruction set.
- **PPU Emulation**: Basic PPU functionality for rendering graphics.
- **APU Emulation**: Basic sound emulation (work in progress).
- **Input Handling**: Keyboard input mapped to NES controller buttons.
- **ROM Loading**: Supports `.nes` ROM files.
- **Debugging**: Basic FPS and CPU register display.

## Current Status

The emulator can run simple NES ROMs like "Super Mario Bros.nes" and "AccuracyCoin.nes" (included for testing; "Super Mario Bros." is git-ignored due to copyright, only "AccuracyCoin.nes" is included). More complex games may not run correctly due to incomplete CPU and PPU implementations.

## Running the Emulator ( it only load AccuracyCoin.nes file for testing )

1. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed.
2. Install Pygame: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the emulator: `python main.py`
4. Done for what
