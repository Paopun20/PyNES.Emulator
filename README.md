A NES (Nintendo Entertainment System) emulator written in 100% Python and some Cython for performance (some parts are written in C/C++ or Rust (not today), so it's still a Python project.).

## Accuracy (can be outdate)

</div>

Not suitable for speedrunning at this timeâ€”please wait for future updates before using PyNES for these purposes.

1. No lag frame like real NES hardware.
2. Code run is still very slow if don't use Cython.
3. Accuracy not 100% yet.

## Features (some work in progress)

- **CPU Emulation**: Partial implementation of the 6502 CPU instruction set.
- **PPU Emulation**: Basic PPU functionality for rendering graphics ( BUG ).
- **APU Emulation**: Basic sound emulation ( WIP ).
- **Input Handling**: Keyboard input mapped to NES controller buttons.
- **ROM Loading**: Supports `.nes` ROM files.
- **Debugging**: Basic FPS and CPU register display.

## Planned Features

- **TAS (Tool-Assisted Speedruns or Tool-Assisted Superplays)**: Implement features to support TAS creation and playback.
- **Enhanced PPU Features**: Complete implementation of PPU features including sprites, scrolling, and palettes.
- **Complete APU Emulation**: Full sound channel support and audio effects.
- **Cython Integration**: Integrate CPython or other Python performance tools for significant speed improvements.
- **Save States**: Implement save and load state functionality.

## Current Status

- CPU: Basic instruction set implemented, but many unofficial opcodes are missing.
- PPU: Basic rendering, but many features are incomplete.
- APU: Work in progress.
- Input: Basic keyboard mapping.
- Performance: Not optimized for speed; primarily for educational purposes.

## Installation

## Running the Emulator

### Run emulator from source code

1. Ensure you have Python 3.8 or higher installed.
2. Clone this repository.
   ```
    git clone https://github.com/Paopun20/PyNES.Emulator.git && cd PyNES.Emulator
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies using:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Start the emulator with:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

5. When prompted by the emulator, choose a `.nes` ROM file to load and play.

### Run emulator from pre-built executable

If you want to use a ready-made executable:

1. Go to the "Actions" tab on this repository's GitHub page.
2. Find and select the "Build PyNES Emulator" workflow.
3. Download the most recent artifact for your operating system (Windows (recommended), Mac, or Linux).
4. Unzip the downloaded file.
5. Run the executable inside.
6. When the emulator starts, select a `.nes` ROM file when prompted.
