Not suitable for speedrunning at this timeâ€”please wait for future updates before using PyNES for these purposes.

1. No lag frame.
2. Run too slow like **shit**.
3. Accuracy like **shit**.

why I make this? it is fun.

## Features (some work in progress)

- **CPU Emulation**: Partial implementation of the 6502 CPU instruction set.
- **PPU Emulation**: Basic PPU functionality for rendering graphics ( BUG ).
- **APU Emulation**: Basic sound emulation ( WIP ).
- **Input Handling**: Keyboard input mapped to NES controller buttons.
- **ROM Loading**: Supports `.nes` ROM files.
- **Debugging**: Basic FPS and CPU register display.

## Current Status

- CPU: Basic instruction set implemented, but many unofficial opcodes are missing.
- PPU: Basic rendering, but many features are incomplete.
- APU: Work in progress.
- Input: Basic keyboard mapping.
- Performance: Not optimized for speed; primarily for educational purposes.
