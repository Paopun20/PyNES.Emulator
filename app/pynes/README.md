# PyNES Core

This folder contains the essential components of the PyNES emulator. Think of it as the fundamental engine—it has no windowing, graphics output, or sound, just the basics you need.

You can use it as a foundation for building your own emulator, exploring how one functions, enhancing accuracy and performance, or adding new features and broader game support.

And don’t forget to copy the utils folder!
