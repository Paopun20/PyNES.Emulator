# PyNES Core

This folder holds the core pieces of the PyNES emulator. Think of it as the bare-bones engine — no windowing, no graphics output, just the essentials.

Use it as a foundation for building your own emulator, digging into how one works, improving accuracy and performance, or bolting on new features and broader game support.
